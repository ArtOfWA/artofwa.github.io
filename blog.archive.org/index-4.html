Hi TP,
Could you please write to info@archive.org and share with us an example or screenshot of the problems you are discovering in search?  That would help us to identify what&#039;s going on and see if it is particular to you and something more system-wide.  
Thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I understand the concern about the sweeping of copyright Reform Proposal

But all I can say is that since DMCA will change rules that govern the internet, and this might have some consequences for the internet information ecosystem the only answer to this That important of sweeping proposals like this cannot be passed just like that.. it will most definitely will affect big tech and big content but although the rule help internet user. Let’s just wait and see how everything plays out in the future]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The library has been a source of information and knowledge of people for a very long time. But nowadays the corporation like google are taking over the place as a source of information. But nowadays Google has taken over as not only a search engine but as a sole provider of information to the people. Which is not good for any corporation to do so. Google or any corporation can take advantage of this situation and can manipulate the information according to their easement which shouldn’t occur under any circumstances. So library provides the feeling of closeness in the society along with the free flow of ideas and information. But the library has to act according to the time to interact with more members, library can create an online forum for its members where they can ask the librarian or can discuss among the members, which will be more beneficial and reliable than the corporation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If you are doing any research, search engines become an option. However, this can lead to problems. The use of a corporation for your library needs can turn things around. Here, we discuss; why trust a corporation to do a library’s job.
For anyone who decides to focus on a corporation to help in library work,  privacy is enhanced. The team hired ensures your work and anything else stays private. Clients can rely on the corporation for accountability when things go wrong. For online searches, you are exposed to anyone out there.
The corporations will ensure your private information does not find its way on social circles. The systems employed will ensure only a few individuals helping get your info.
If you outsource your library needs to corporations, you access different tools that are vital to your needs.]]></description>
